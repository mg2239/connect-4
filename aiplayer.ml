(**The minmax tree of possible moves is represented as a 7-ary tree where
   the root node is the current state and the children of a node are the states
   resulting from possible moves. A leaf in the tree is represented by a node
   whose list of child nodes is empty. Scores are initially only evaluated at
   a leaf. Score values at all other nodes are set to 0.
